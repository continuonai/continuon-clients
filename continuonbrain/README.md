# ContinuonBrain (placeholder)

This monorepo keeps ContinuonXR code. The ContinuonBrain/OS runtime belongs in its own repo (`continuonos`) with platform-agnostic core, HAL adapters, backends, and configs. Keep shared contracts in `proto/continuonbrain_link.proto` and mirror them downstream. No runtime code lives here.
