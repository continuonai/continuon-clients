ensure that our seed model brain is fully autonomous for training on new RLDS episodes for this machine. eventually it'll be exported to a gcp instance for hosting and distribution via the continuonai.com website. seed models will be distributed for new robot machines that are registered, and then for updates, new slow loop training updates are made available to robots for OTA updates.
