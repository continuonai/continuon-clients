# worldtapeai.com (redirect)

WorldTapeAI's RLDS browser/annotation experience is now embedded inside the ContinuonAI consumer app/robot controller housed in `continuonai/`. This folder stays as a lightweight redirect and DNS note-only stub; ship all implementation and build steps with the Flutter app.

- Primary entry point: `continuonai/README.md` for the consumer app + in-app RLDS portal.
- Contracts to align with: `docs/monorepo-structure.md`, `docs/upload-readiness-checklist.md`, and the proto definitions under `proto/`.
