# ContinuonXR Architecture (Redirect)

This file is intentionally kept as a **short redirect** to avoid duplicating system design docs.

- Canonical system design: `docs/system-architecture.md`
- Training runbook: `docs/training-plan.md`
- Governance + OTA: `docs/model_lifecycle.md`
- Repo boundaries: `docs/monorepo-structure.md`

Notes:
- Product naming: use **Continuon Brain runtime** (preferred) vs. legacy **ContinuonBrain/OS**.
