# Agent Instructions (ContinuonAI placeholder)

Scope: `continuonai/`.

- Use this folder for organizational specs and orchestration notes that mirror the dedicated ContinuonAI repo. Avoid implementing CI/CD tooling here beyond illustrative snippets.
- Keep references to shared contracts (episode schema, robot API, XR app spec) in sync with the root README and `proto/` definitions.
- Prefer concise, versioned docs; capture decision records when changing cross-repo contracts.
- Testing expectations: documentation-only; no commands required unless new scripts are added.
