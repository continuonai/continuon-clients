# Agent Instructions (Continuon-Cloud placeholder)

Scope: `continuonai/continuon-cloud/`.

- Treat this directory as documentation/spec staging for the separate Continuon-Cloud repo. Do not land production ingestion/training code here.
- Keep cloud environment notes minimal and repo-agnostic (e.g., example GCP project/bucket/service-account names) and avoid secrets.
- When adjusting cloud contracts or references, ensure they stay consistent with `docs/monorepo-structure.md` and root README descriptions.
- Testing expectations: documentation-only changes require link/format sanity checks; no CI commands are required unless you add executable scripts.
