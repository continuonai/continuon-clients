# Continuon-Cloud (placeholder)

Cloud ingest/train/packaging should live in a dedicated repo. This `continuonai/continuon-cloud/` folder is a staging area for specs only (Google Cloud-only backend assumptions); do not add production pipelines here. Refer to `docs/monorepo-structure.md` for the decoupled architecture and keep RLDS/schema updates coordinated via `proto/`.
