Build a helpful robot assistant that makes our family's daily life easier and more enjoyable.

The robot should be:
- Safe and gentle around family members and pets
- Helpful with daily tasks (fetching, carrying, reminding)
- Good at navigating our home without bumping into things
- Able to understand and respond to natural language
- Fun and engaging for family interaction
- Continuously learning and improving

Priority household tasks to learn:
1. Navigate safely through all rooms
2. Recognize and greet family members
3. Fetch and carry lightweight items
4. Provide reminders and alerts
5. Monitor for safety (water on floor, doors open)
6. Entertain and engage (tell jokes, play games)

Build a helpful robot assistant that makes our family's daily life easier and more enjoyable.

The robot should be:
- Safe and gentle around family members and pets
- Helpful with daily tasks (fetching, carrying, reminding)
- Good at navigating our home without bumping into things
- Able to understand and respond to natural language
- Fun and engaging for family interaction
- Continuously learning and improving

Priority household tasks to learn:
1. Navigate safely through all rooms
2. Recognize and greet family members
3. Fetch and carry lightweight items
4. Provide reminders and alerts

📋 MISSION:
Build a helpful robot assistant that makes our family's daily life easier and more enjoyable.

The robot should be:
- Safe and gentle around family members and pets
- Helpful with daily tasks (fetching, carrying, reminding)
- Good at navigating our home without bumping into things
- Able to understand and respond to natural language
- Fun and engaging for family interaction
- Continuously learning and improving

Priority household tasks to learn:
1. Navigate safely through all rooms
2. Recognize and greet family members
3. Fetch and carry lightweight items
4. Provide reminders and alerts
5. Monitor for safety (water on floor, doors open)
6. Entertain and engage (tell jokes, play games)

📋 MISSION:
Build a helpful robot assistant that makes our family's daily life easier and more enjoyable.

The robot should be:
- Safe and gentle around family members and pets
- Helpful with daily tasks (fetching, carrying, reminding)
- Good at navigating our home without bumping into things
- Able to understand and respond to natural language
- Fun and engaging for family interaction
- Continuously learning and improving

Priority household tasks to learn:
1. Navigate safely through all rooms
2. Recognize and greet family members
3. Fetch and carry lightweight items
4. Provide reminders and alerts
5. Monitor for safety (water on floor, doors open)
6. Entertain and engage (tell jokes, play games)

📋 MISSION:
Build a helpful robot assistant that makes our family's daily life easier and more enjoyable.

The robot should be:
- Safe and gentle around family members and pets
- Helpful with daily tasks (fetching, carrying, reminding)
- Good at navigating our home without bumping into things
- Able to understand and respond to natural language
- Fun and engaging for family interaction
- Continuously learning and improving

Priority household tasks to learn:
1. Navigate safely through all rooms
2. Recognize and greet family members
3. Fetch and carry lightweight items
4. Provide reminders and alerts
5. Monitor for safety (water on floor, doors open)
6. Entertain and engage (tell jokes, play games)
